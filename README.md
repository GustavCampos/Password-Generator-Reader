# Password-Generator-Reader
This a prototype of a password generator and one a day a password reader too.

My first objective with this project is learn how to implement OOP in JavaScript.
To be honestly i'm sure that my project still have a lot of mistakes involving design pattern and i'll love to se how this can be improved.
